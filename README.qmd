Code and slides for the PyData Northern Utah workshop.

It's assumed you already have Python installed (I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)) along with an IDE (I recommend using [Positron](https://positron.posit.co)). For more details on getting set up with a recommended data tool stack, see this [training](https://github.com/marcdotson/asc-training).

## Project Organization

- `/figures` PNG images and plots.
